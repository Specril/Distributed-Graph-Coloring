# Distributed Node Graph Coloring Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains a Java implementation of a distributed node graph coloring algorithm. The algorithm is designed to efficiently color the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color, using a distributed approach.
